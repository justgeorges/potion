# pinotion
Connecting pinterest and notion apis to allow more fluid style management. 

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore Pipedream's API connecting features by creating a seemless bridge between Pinterest and Notion.
Pinterest allows users to save and organize visual content into boards by 'pinning' them. 
Notion is an all-in-one note-taking and organization software that allows personalizable organized spaces. 
I use Pinterest to collect ideas for my personal fashion, and I use Notion to organize my thoughts. 

# My Pain
While Pinterest is a fantastic resource for finding outfit and design ideas, there is a gap between its functionality and vintage/secondhand shopping experience. As vintage stores can hold a mix of styles and secondhand shops often have an large amount of clothing, shopping vintage/secondhand without a game plan can be an overwhelming experience that sees me often leaving empty-handed.
Combining Notion's note-taking and database organization with Pinterests resources would allow me to more effectively organize and filter through lists of pieces I'm interesting in finding, ultimately allowing easier creation of a "game plan" when going shopping.
